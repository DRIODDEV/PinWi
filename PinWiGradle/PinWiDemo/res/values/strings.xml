Psychologists say, unlike aptitude and inherent skills, interests are ever-evolving. For a more well rounded development its important for children balance both aptitude and interests.</item>
        <item>Children who love quizzes and trivia are mostly driven by a hunger to seek knowledge, as are children who enjoy going to museums. Both reflect an interest that involves feeding a curious mind to learn more about the world, its people, their ideas, views and experiences.</item>
